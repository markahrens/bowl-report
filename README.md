<h1>
  🏈 College Football Bowl Report 🏈
</h1>

I couldn't find a good place to get data about college football bowl games, so I made the [Bowl Report](https://bowl.report) site.

The site was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

The data for the site can be found in `data/bowls` with each bowl game as a separate file.

If you want to build the site yourself, you can clone or fork this repo and run the following commands:

1. `yarn install`
2. `gatsby develop`
